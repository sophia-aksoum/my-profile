            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;"> Hello!! My name is Sophia Aksoum. I was born in Lyon in France. I have led a pretty international life after studying in an international School called Ombrosa which gave me many oppurtunities. Also, as I've been constantly visiting many places around the world throughout my vacations, Canada and Japan being one of my favourite places, I have become curious :) and open-minded. I'm currenty living in Cergy, where I am studying a degree in Business Administration at ESSEC Business School

          <h2>MY ASSOCIATION</h2>
          <p>
           I  am part of an association called PLM (Parrainages Lyon Madagascar) since 2020. In this association, I am the godmother of three Malagasy children. I exchange several times per year with them thanks to letters. My parents finance their scholar fees. This is something that I'm very proud of because I think that when we can, it is very important to help people who need it.

        <h2>TRAVEL</h2>
          <p> I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people,etc. In my opinion, seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college clas. When we travel, we have the possibility of learning a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or even acquiring a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. </p>

          <p>Also, I feel like travelling helps to open your mind. You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Especially, meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.</p>

          <p>I personally prefer to visit places where the weather is warm, such as Morroco, Dubai, Greece, Turkey... Nonethless, as I already said before, one of the places that I prefered was Canada and trust me it's not always that warm over there ! I went there 3 times and visited each corner of it. I went to Alberta twice in an exchange and I visited the Canadian Rockies which were just amazing. I also xent with my family to Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, Niagara and a little island where I met whales.

        <h2>MY PASSION</h2>
        <p>
        I am passionate about fashion since ever. It is my grand-mother who gave me the taste of it beacause she used to work in the fashion industry at Printemps Boulevard Hausmann. I've always dreamed to work in this sector espcially the luxury one. I have a favourite designer, Yves Saint Laurent. I love his work that I first discovered in the museums dedicated to him in Morroco and in Paris. He is an Algerian and I am too, and we can find a bit of the Algerian culture in his creations which reminds me my origins. Therefore, I think that this a brand that looks like me and I would love to work there.
